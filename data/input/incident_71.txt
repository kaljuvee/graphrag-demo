During the afternoon shift on 14th April, a loose bolt caused a malfunction in the assembly line's robotic arm, leading to a near-miss incident between the equipment and a plant operator. Had the operator not noticed and avoided the erratic movement promptly, the incident could have led to severe personal injury and significant machinery damage.
